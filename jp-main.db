paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":["ins","itm"],"custom":""},"spellcasting":"half","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/light_05.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"re2DugVtFJThQIJS","name":"Divine Smite","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage.</p><p>The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible.

The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial.

At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":["ins","itm"],"custom":""},"spellcasting":"half","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/light_05.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"re2DugVtFJThQIJS","name":"Divine Smite","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage.</p><p>The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

Archetypes</h1>\n<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Thief</h2>\n<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p>\n<h3>Thief Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ga3dt2zrCn2MHK8R]{Fast Hands} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.FGrbXs6Ku5qxFK5G]{Second-Story Work}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Ei1Oh4UAA2E30jcD]{Supreme Sneak}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.NqWyHE7Rpw9lyKWu]{Use Magic Device}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.LhRm1EeUMvp2EWhV]{Thief's Reflexes}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Mastermind","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","per","prf","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"none","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.xEb8jmA5HlNs7xTF"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/gray_04.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"q8B7lXajtmRU84UR","name":"Cunning Action","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.

Archetypes</h1>\n<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Thief</h2>\n<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p>\n<h3>Thief Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ga3dt2zrCn2MHK8R]{Fast Hands} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.FGrbXs6Ku5qxFK5G]{Second-Story Work}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Ei1Oh4UAA2E30jcD]{Supreme Sneak}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.NqWyHE7Rpw9lyKWu]{Use Magic Device}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.LhRm1EeUMvp2EWhV]{Thief's Reflexes}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Mastermind","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","per","prf","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"none","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.xEb8jmA5HlNs7xTF"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/gray_04.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"q8B7lXajtmRU84UR","name":"Cunning Action","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book’s Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"S0MaCib5qV1MEYOF","name":"Arcane Tradition","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 115","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":"","width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"Wizard 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":300000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_08.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"g7ZsCcHjwuwIE6lJ","name":"Dagger","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A short metal blade mounted to a small hilt and crossguard.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book’s Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book&rsquo;s Appearance.</strong></em>&nbsp;Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Armoror","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":[],"value":["arc","his"],"custom":""},"spellcasting":"artificer"},"sort":500000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.E6H2y24OYJ5kdMvn"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"K6SzvgyS2nEzGUDb","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book&rsquo;s Appearance.</strong></em>&nbsp;Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Armoror","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":[],"value":["arc","his"],"custom":""},"spellcasting":"artificer"},"sort":500000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.E6H2y24OYJ5kdMvn"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"K6SzvgyS2nEzGUDb","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1stlevel wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3>\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book’s Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"S0MaCib5qV1MEYOF","name":"Arcane Tradition","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 115","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":"","width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"Wizard 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":300000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_08.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"g7ZsCcHjwuwIE6lJ","name":"Dagger","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A short metal blade mounted to a small hilt and crossguard.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book’s Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"S0MaCib5qV1MEYOF","name":"Arcane Tradition","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 115","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":"","width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"Wizard 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":300000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_08.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"g7ZsCcHjwuwIE6lJ","name":"Dagger","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A short metal blade mounted to a small hilt and crossguard.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":["ins","itm"],"custom":""},"spellcasting":"half","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/light_05.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"re2DugVtFJThQIJS","name":"Divine Smite","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage.</p><p>The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible.

The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious.

Archetypes</h1>\n<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Thief</h2>\n<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p>\n<h3>Thief Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ga3dt2zrCn2MHK8R]{Fast Hands} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.FGrbXs6Ku5qxFK5G]{Second-Story Work}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Ei1Oh4UAA2E30jcD]{Supreme Sneak}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.NqWyHE7Rpw9lyKWu]{Use Magic Device}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.LhRm1EeUMvp2EWhV]{Thief's Reflexes}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Mastermind","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","per","prf","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"none","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.xEb8jmA5HlNs7xTF"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/gray_04.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"q8B7lXajtmRU84UR","name":"Cunning Action","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.

Archetypes</h1>\n<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Thief</h2>\n<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p>\n<h3>Thief Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ga3dt2zrCn2MHK8R]{Fast Hands} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.FGrbXs6Ku5qxFK5G]{Second-Story Work}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Ei1Oh4UAA2E30jcD]{Supreme Sneak}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.NqWyHE7Rpw9lyKWu]{Use Magic Device}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.LhRm1EeUMvp2EWhV]{Thief's Reflexes}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Mastermind","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","per","prf","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"none","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.xEb8jmA5HlNs7xTF"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/gray_04.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"q8B7lXajtmRU84UR","name":"Cunning Action","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.

Archetypes</h1>\n<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Thief</h2>\n<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p>\n<h3>Thief Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ga3dt2zrCn2MHK8R]{Fast Hands} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.FGrbXs6Ku5qxFK5G]{Second-Story Work}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Ei1Oh4UAA2E30jcD]{Supreme Sneak}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.NqWyHE7Rpw9lyKWu]{Use Magic Device}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.LhRm1EeUMvp2EWhV]{Thief's Reflexes}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Mastermind","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","per","prf","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"none","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.xEb8jmA5HlNs7xTF"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/gray_04.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"q8B7lXajtmRU84UR","name":"Cunning Action","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.

Archetypes</h1>\n<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Thief</h2>\n<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p>\n<h3>Thief Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ga3dt2zrCn2MHK8R]{Fast Hands} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.FGrbXs6Ku5qxFK5G]{Second-Story Work}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Ei1Oh4UAA2E30jcD]{Supreme Sneak}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.NqWyHE7Rpw9lyKWu]{Use Magic Device}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.LhRm1EeUMvp2EWhV]{Thief's Reflexes}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Mastermind","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","per","prf","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"none","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.xEb8jmA5HlNs7xTF"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/gray_04.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"q8B7lXajtmRU84UR","name":"Cunning Action","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions.

As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p><p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book&rsquo;s Appearance.</strong></em>&nbsp;Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Armoror","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":[],"value":["arc","his"],"custom":""},"spellcasting":"artificer"},"sort":500000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.E6H2y24OYJ5kdMvn"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"K6SzvgyS2nEzGUDb","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1stlevel wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast.

With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.

You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3>\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table.

You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book&rsquo;s Appearance.</strong></em>&nbsp;Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"Armoror","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":[],"value":["arc","his"],"custom":""},"spellcasting":"artificer"},"sort":500000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.E6H2y24OYJ5kdMvn"}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"K6SzvgyS2nEzGUDb","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":["ins","itm"],"custom":""},"spellcasting":"half","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/light_05.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"re2DugVtFJThQIJS","name":"Divine Smite","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage.</p><p>The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":8,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":["ins","itm"],"custom":""},"spellcasting":"half","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/light_05.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"re2DugVtFJThQIJS","name":"Divine Smite","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage.</p><p>The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible.
